# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A Python Tkinter based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that visually demonstrates Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort with adjustable speed and array size.

# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Python + Tkinter)

A visually interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Python and Tkinter**.  
This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work internally by
displaying real-time animations of array sorting.

🧠 Algorithms Explained
🔹 Bubble Sort

Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order

Simple but inefficient for large datasets

Time Complexity: O(n²)

🔹 Quick Sort

Uses a pivot element to partition the array

Faster and efficient in most cases

Average Time Complexity: O(n log n)

🔹 Merge Sort

Divide and conquer algorithm

Stable and efficient for large data

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
